  <h1>Alternate Communications Devices as Research</h1>
  <h2>Designing to Thwart Surveillance Under the Danger of Authoritarianism</h2>

  <p>We live in a surveillance culture and state facilitated by continuously advancing technologies. Opting-in is nominally optional, yet communications media like smartphones and the Internet are, for most people, required for livelihood on the grid. This
    has led to the establishment of a watchlist culture that keeps us not only as refined targets of consumer advertising, but also as well-documented citizens of a state that is opaque about its actions and unmerciful towards whistleblowers. While the
    promise of new communications technology is typified by its power to be democratic and freeing, we are instead faced with the contradictory threat of surveillance in a state with a limitless potential for the abuse of power. Emerging from this problem
    is the quest to establish new ways of communicating, sharing information, and organizing.
  </p>
  <p>Our newly elected President, Donald Trump, who is “completely obsessed with revenge,” is a major contemporary cause of anxiety in relation to power abuse. For good reason: apart from his stated plans to register American muslims and deport 3 million
    illegal immigrants, he will soon have the key to a trove of surveillance resources developed over the last 16 years by the Bush and Obama administrations. This includes the until recently secret government programs that utilize the communications
    technologies we trust: The NSA datamining tool Boundless Informant, the PRISM surveillance program that compels, by law, technology giants to hand their data to the government, and XKeyscore, the tool the NSA uses to collect “nearly everything a user
    does on the Internet.” Trump will soon inherit this surveillance apparatus, and he has made clear he will not be transparent about his own activities, even down to his tax returns. With regard to the NSA’s surveillance capabilities, Trump stated prior
    to his election: “I wish I had that power. Man, that would be power.” What he will do with that power is yet to be seen, but the outlook is grim. In the words of political cartoonist Ted Rall, “the next few years promise to devolve into a dystopian
    nightmare of authoritarian repression the likes of which few Americans ever imagined possible.” In short, it could get worse.
  </p>
  <p>The scales have been tipped so unfavorably that there is finally some anticipated and ongoing resistance to government activities, including street protests in reaction to Trump’s election, emerging networks of safe houses and sanctuary cities, and
    American citizens expressing willingness to risk prison to assist undocumented persons. The roles of activism, journalism, and whistleblowing in this environment will only continue to gain importance over the next four years. These groups heavily
    rely on communications tools to gather evidence, organize, share information, and publish stories. But, the surveillance apparatus creates danger in using mainstream networks and devices. Which leads to the designer’s research question: can we connect
    via technology without our privacy breached? Two communications designs may provide solutions to this problem.
  </p>
  <p>The Introspection Engine, designed by whistleblower Edward Snowden and engineer Andrew Huang, is a prototype smartphone accessory that allows users to monitor if their devices are making radio transmissions that could leak their location. While working
    on a limited budget, they hope to complete the project over the next year. Their prototype is designed to look like a battery case, with an external screen that reliably updates the user on the status of the device’s radios, whether or not the phone
    has been compromised. The case is complete with a kill switch to shut off the phone’s power if signals are detected. Snowden and Huang aim to refine their design so that it is open source, intuitive to use, and works on any model phone. Their research
    has included buying spare mobile device parts and manuals from electronics markets in China in order to examine mobile logic boards for radio test points. If successful, this design could facilitate the work of journalists in the field whose lives
    and livelihood depend on not being tracked.
  </p>
  <p>The ability to anonymously transfer information and communicate is crucial to this kind of work. This is something that the Tor Project—a distributed, anonymous web browser—also enables. Tor was originally developed in the 90’s to serve as a secure
    network for government agencies, and the project still receives much of its backing from the State Department and the Department of Defense. Now maintained by Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson, anyone can use Tor and benefit from this protected
    network. In his work on Tor, Dingledine sought to answer his own question: "how can we build a system that gives you privacy in the face of the large governments who are surveilling the Internet as much as they can?" Ironically but unsurprisingly,
    Tor has come under attack from other branches of government such as the FBI, which as repeatedly funded programs to de-anonymize the browser. Instead of blocking radio transmissions, Tor preserves anonymity by reducing the risk of traffic analysis:
    a package of data that reveals an Internet user’s identity, behavior, interests and activities. Tor works by “onion routing”—connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection. Tor also gives access to the “dark
    web,” which contains sites whose publishers also remain anonymous. Like any place without oversight, the dark web has had its share of infamy—notably the drug trafficking site Silk Road, which has been shut down—but it also gives access to critical
    resources for journalists, including Wikileaks and the New Yorker Strongbox, which whistleblowers can use to contribute documents without being tracked. In its current iteration, Tor does have a weakness: a user can still be pinpointed in a malware
    attack.
  </p>
  <p>To test if these designs are solving the question of how to effectively and safely communicate anonymously, several research methods could be implemented. Quantitative research could be generated in the form of surveys and questionnaires targeting people
    who engage in high risk activity, perhaps anonymously via Tor. When possible, data should be collected about governmental surveillance and the complementary role of technology companies—however, it is likely that much of this information will be difficult
    to access without the assistance of whistleblowers. Research into this question would also likely require confidential, in-person interviews and a more qualitative approach. Case studies could be conducted featuring journalists, activists, and others
    targeted by the NSA, including the no-fly list. Action research could also bear relevance, as testing and refinement may be best conducted by insider journalists who would truly use these designs long term and are connected to like-minded communities.
    Down the line, ethnographic studies could be done, addressing the question: how have the development of these items led to changing practices in connected communities?
  </p>
  <p>The evaluation of these designs rests on the following criteria: if they work as private communication devices, if they encourage the continued practice of journalism and activism, and if people can and are truly participating in the use of these networks
    and tools, whether or not they are tech savvy. Potential roadblocks include the anonymous and secret nature of these platforms, which make it very hard to collect data, a potential reliance on whistleblowing, and small user sample size. There are
    several wicked problems when it comes to anonymous communication tools. First is the basic premise and ideology of free speech, wherein these tools could potentially enable illegal activity with which there is grave moral opposition. There is also
    some degree of irony in using devices that, in some respects, rely on the preservation of exclusive communities. But in addressing the problem at hand—how to make communication safe and anonymous for journalists and activists—there is the problem
    where in the mere fact of possession of these devices, one is automatically a greater target for surveillance. Furthermore, with increased overall usage, there will be greater incentive for powerful groups such as the FBI to create systems that thwart
    anonymity.
  </p>
  <p>Much of the impact of these designs is yet to be seen, but they show the potential for new ways of dealing with the panopticon state. It is quite possible that these devices and designs like them will become more relevant under the upcoming administration
    and beyond. As designers, it is important to be aware of how new technologies, particularly in communications, can be co-opted for ill-purposes, and to consider how the might be alternatively created and used off the main grid.</p>

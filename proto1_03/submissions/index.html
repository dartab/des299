                <h5>Submissions due May 14, 2018</h5>
                <h2>Collecting images, sketches, video, audio, writings, and other screen-adaptable media for a webzine edition that addresses issues in late capitalism.</h2>

                <p>This issue allows for a broad array of thematic content. You may submit any material that addresses your anxieties about the present/future, your coping mechanisms, the violent history of the development of the modern world, and injustices
                  you would like to address. Submissions can also take a constructive approach, bringing up theories and methods for addressing inequalities and strategies for structural change. Your submissions may alternatively capture the "essence"
                  of this late capitalist stage in its vernacular and/or imagery, which often includes irreverence and irony. Perhaps there are even aspects you would like to celebrate. Send them in!</p>
                <h3>What's happening with this?</h3>
                <p>Your submissions will be published online as a part of the first zine issue of <em>Alien WebMD</em>. The collection of works will be included in an exhibition at the <a href="https://manettishremmuseum.ucdavis.edu/visit/upcoming_exhibitions.html">Manetti Shrem Art Museum</a>                  in Davis, CA, opening May 31st, 2018. Thanks for your participation!
                </p>
